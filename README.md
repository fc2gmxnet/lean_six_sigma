# Lean Six Sigma
Tools to implement Lean Six Sigma using Python.

Tools like Minitab are great, but the goal of this repository is to show alternatives with free software.

Work in progress! :-)

### Design of Experiments: A virtual catapult

Play a bit with an online available catapult and create a model which will set input parameters for a desired target value.

This classic process example will lead to learn about:

- Getting the most insights from a process with the smallest number of experiments.
- Screening: discover critical process input variables and fix variables which cause higher process variability.
- Modeling: create a regression model which uses the critical process input variables to predict the output variable.
- Checking if the model actually is able to predict the output variable... in the worst of the cases, arriving to this point has already brought quite a full learning of the model and the experiment data will not be wasted.
- A little twist: I identified non-linearity in the model, which I was able to handle by tweaking the algorithm towards a solution.  In normal conditions further experiments would have been required.
